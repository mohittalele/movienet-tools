# Introduction
movienet-tools is an open source movie analysis toolbox based on PyTorch.
It's part of [MovieNet](http://movienet.site/) project maintained by MovieNet Team from [MMLab, CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk).
And it is also one of [OpenMMLab](https://open-mmlab.github.io/index.html) projects.

## Features
- Basic video processing tools.
- Holistic semantic video feature extractors.
- All-in-one movie info web crawler.

## Installation
Please refer to [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for installation and dataset preparation. Pretrained models and dataset are also explanined here.

## Get Started
Please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the wiki of movienet data and the basic usage of this toolbox.

## Acknowledgement
The structure of ``movienet-tools`` follows that of codebased in [openmmlab](https://github.com/open-mmlab).
The part of character detection are modified from [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)
and the part of action feature extraction are modified from [mmaction](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction).
Many thanks to these open-source codebases.
